| 0.007 | Mini-card | **17,520 Hours** — Michelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel ceiling. Four years, 12 hours a day, contorted on scaffolding 70 feet up. A masterpiece for the ages — consumed in a fraction of a second of collective scrolling. |
| 0.02 | Text | Every 10 seconds, humanity burns through 2.5 million hours on social media. This card represents that time, to scale. |
| 0.04 | Text | We rarely see time waste represented to scale. This is part of the reason we consistently fail to grasp just how much of our collective life is disappearing into feeds. |
| 0.071 | Mini-card | **175,200 Hours** — Building the Great Pyramid of Giza. Twenty years, 20,000 workers, 2.3 million stone blocks. One of the greatest construction feats in human history — and we scroll past it in seconds. |
| 0.13 | Mini-card | **~340,000 Hours** — Time it would take to read all of Wikipedia. Every word, every article. That's how far you've scrolled — and it's barely a fraction of what we spend in 10 seconds. |

| 0.22 | Text | Keep scrolling. We're not even close. |
| 0.285 | Mini-card | **700,800 Hours** — One entire human lifetime — 80 years. Every waking moment, every sleeping one. Born, lived, died. That's how much time you've scrolled past. |
| 0.37 | Text | And every single mini card you just passed — the Pyramids, Wikipedia, a human lifetime, Voyager 1 — all of them fit in the first third of this card. |
| 0.47 | Text | OK, we're coming up on the end now. |
| 0.52 | Text | Just kidding. We're not even halfway. Keep scrolling. |
| 0.57 | Text | The time represented by this card is consumed every 10 seconds. By the time you finish scrolling, it will have happened many times over. |
| 0.65 | Text | 2.5 million hours. That's 3.5 entire human lifetimes. Consumed. Every. 10. Seconds. |
| 0.75 | Text | Instead, we scroll. |
| 0.82 | Text | This isn't about guilt. It's about scale. We simply cannot comprehend how much time we are giving away. |
| 0.86 | Text | You're almost at the end of this card. 10 more seconds just passed. Another 2.5 million hours, gone. |
| 0.90 | Video | **brainrot2.mp4** — Caption top: "Some brainrot for you..." / Caption bottom: "We haven't lost you yet, have we?" |
| 0.98 | Text | The scroll is endless — your time isn't. |
