## Card: 2,459,490 Hours — Time spent on social media globally, every 10 seconds
| Position | Type | Content |

| 0.02 | Text | You're not alone in this scroll... |
| 0.05 | Text | Every 10 seconds, humanity burns through 2.5 million hours on social media. This card represents that time, to scale. |
| 0.08 | Text | We rarely see time waste represented to scale. This is part of the reason we consistently fail to grasp just how much of our collective life is disappearing into feeds. |
| 0.12 | Mini-card | **320,000 Hours** — Time it would take to read all of Wikipedia. Every word, every article. That's how far you've scrolled — and it's barely a fraction of what we spend in 10 seconds. |
| 0.16 | Text | Keep scrolling. We're not even close. |
| 0.20 | Text | You might think 320,000 hours sounds like a lot. It is. It's half a human lifetime. But we blow past way it every 10 seconds without a thought. |
| 0.26 | Mini-card | **700,800 Hours** — One entire human lifetime — 80 years. Every waking moment, every sleeping one. Born, lived, died. That's how much time you've scrolled past. |
| 0.28 | Text | One complete human life. Gone in a fraction of this scroll. |
| 0.33 | Text | And we're not even a quarter of the way through what humanity spends in 10 seconds. |
| 0.38 | Text | Think about that. Everything you will ever experience — every joy, every heartbreak, every sunrise — fits in less than a quarter of this card. |
| 0.43 | Text | OK, we're coming up on the end now. |
| 0.48 | Text | Just kidding. We're not even halfway. Keep scrolling. |
| 0.53 | Text | The time represented by this card is consumed every 10 seconds. By the time you finish scrolling, it will have happened many times over. |
| 0.58 | Text | No single app or platform created this problem. We did — collectively, one scroll at a time. |
| 0.63 | Text | 2.5 million hours. That's 3.5 entire human lifetimes. Consumed. Every. 10. Seconds. |
| 0.68 | Text | If this time were given to a single person, they would live from the Stone Age to today — and still have lifetimes to spare. |
| 0.73 | Text | We could read every Wikipedia article four times over. We could build monuments. We could learn languages, write novels, raise families. |
| 0.78 | Text | Instead, we scroll. |
| 0.83 | Text | This isn't about guilt. It's about scale. We simply cannot comprehend how much time we are giving away. |
| 0.86 | Text | You're almost at the end of this card. 10 more seconds just passed. Another 2.5 million hours, gone. |
| 0.90 | Video | **brainrot2.mp4** — Caption top: "Some brainrot for you..." / Caption bottom: "We haven't lost you yet, have we?" |
| 0.96 | Text | The scroll is endless — your time isn't. |
